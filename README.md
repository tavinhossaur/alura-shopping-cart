# alura-shopping-cart
Simple project made as a challenge from the Alura course "Java: Working with lists and data collections"

This project was an opportunity for me to improve my systems design skills, working with classes, making my own exceptions and training my ability to see the project as a whole, and also use the JavaDoc tool to make simple and accurate comments.
